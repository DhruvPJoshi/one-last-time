            <section>
                <p>For the moment, let's go back to first year.</p>
                <p class="fragment">Remember that time, when we were introduced to the <i>'C programming language'</i> for the first time?</p>
                <p class="fragment">Yes. I'm talking about that very first &quot;Hello World&quot; program.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>The key point we learned from that program was:</p>
                <blockquote class="fragment">
                    &ldquo;Program execution begins from main() method.&rdquo;
                </blockquote>
                <p class="fragment fade-left">I want you to pay a closer attention here, <span class="fragment fade-in">because our life is very much similar to this &quot;main()&quot; method.</span></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>We all know that when we try to execute a program,</p>
                <p class="fragment">it is first loaded inside the computer's main memory.</p>
                <p class="fragment">After that, the main() method's execution begins.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>In a very similar fashion, when we are born, when we come into existance,</p>
                <p class="fragment">we are loaded into this gigantic memory, this world,</p>
                <p class="fragment">and the main() method, our life, begins its execution.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>If you feel convinced, at all, with the forementioned explanation,</p>
                <p class="fragment">then I'm very grateful to have someone who understands what I'm trying to say here.</p>
                <p class="fragment">And for those who didn't feel convinced at all...</p>
                <p class="fragment"><b><emp>"Are bola na relative hai"</emp></b></p>
                <p class="fragment">Anyway, let's move ahead. Shall we?</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>Um.<span class="fragment"> Functions.</span> <span class="fragment">Let's talk a little bit more about them.</span></p>
                <p class="fragment">Almost everything we do in our life, every task we perform, are like function calls.</p>
                <p class="fragment">There are some tasks, <span class="fragment">like predefined
                functions,</span> <span class="fragment">that we perform everyday,</span></p>
                <p class="fragment">without having any idea about how that happens. <span class="fragment">All we know is that it just happens.</span></p>
                <p class="fragment">Like <emp>Dreams.</emp> <span class="fragment">We know we see them.</span> <span class="fragment">But we don't know &quot;How?&quot; or &quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>And there are also some tasks, <span class="fragment">that we perform everyday,</span></p>
                <p class="fragment">with some level of knowledge on how &quot;something&quot; happens.</p>
                <p class="fragment">There are many such tasks, like <span class="fragment">WakeUp(),</span> <span class="fragment">Move(),</span> <span class="fragment">PickUp(),</span> <span class="fragment">Eat(),</span> <span class="fragment">Run(),</span> <span class="fragment">Play(),...</span> <span class="fragment">And the list goes on.</span></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>One of such function calls is,</p>
